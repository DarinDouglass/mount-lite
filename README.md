# Mount lite

I like the idea of [Mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount), a lot. But, I don't need ClojureScript (and its CLJC or 
CLJS modes), I liked the idea of using meta data directly in the state vars better, I don't need suspending, and I 
wanted a nicer API.
 
This is Mount Lite. Clojure only, no suspending, flexible and composable API, substitutions are possible (and cleaner 
in my opinion) and states stop automatically whenever they are redefined (just like Mount, can be turned off). That's it.

You like it? Feel free to use it. Don't like it? The original Mount is great as well!
